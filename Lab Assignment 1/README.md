Lab Assignment Summary:

Lab Assignment 1 has 6 Parts:

Part 1: Printing to Console:
In part 1 we use variables and f-strings to print basic informations of group members.

Part 2: Python Fundamentals:
in part 2, we practiced python data types ( Lists, Tuples, Dictionaries, Sets, Classes & Functions )

Part 3: Using Pandas for Data Management:
We loaded CSV files, merging the dataframe on StudentID, calculated GPA by mean of two rows, removed duplicate names, sorted data. 

Part 4: Data Analytics using Pandas:
In part 4, we merged multiple datasets and done group analytics. Loaded another CSV file and merged it with previous one. Computed mean GPA per homeroom, Multi-key sorting, produced rank list.

Part 5: Using Matplotlib for Data Analytics:
Plotted Histograms to see distributions. Scatter Plot to see relationships between english and math grades.These are used to verify dataset distribution, spread and clustering. 


Part 6: Linear LSE:
Implemented polynomial curve fitting using unweighted and weighhted LSE for true and noisy obervations. For degrees 2, 4, & 6 we computed  coefficients, APV factor, residuals and covariance for weighted LSE and unweighted LSE to evaluate model performance.
